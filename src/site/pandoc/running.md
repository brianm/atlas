# Running

Invoking atlas without any arguments will show the basic help

    $ atlas

    Missing one or both of environment or system specification paths
    Option                                  Description
    ------                                  -----------
    -e, --env, --environment                Environment specification file
    -s, --sys, --system                     System specification file

Atlas only needs two arguments on the command line: the path to the
[environment specification](#environment-specification) and the path to the
[system specification](#system-specification). Everything else is configured within those two files.
