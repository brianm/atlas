BoundTemplate.upgradeFrom(InstalledElement root): UpgradePlan

UpgradePlan is a recursive thing, like the elements.

General gist: 
** New Servers
   - Provision new instances
   - Initialize new instances
   - Install new instances
** Changed Servers
   - apply new initializations
   - uninstall changed installations
   - install changed installations
** Removed Servers
   - uninstall installations
   - unintialize initializers
   - destroy hosts

 End result needs to be an InstalledSystem, just like the intiial
 state.
