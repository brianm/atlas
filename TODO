* Identity can be assigned. 
  This is important for stateful nodes (ie, databases) in case they ar
  emoved in the topology.

* Basic upgrade sequence
  Match identity to current installed servers, if matched then build
  the next stage from information in the installed node. If there is a
  difference that needs to be adjusted, build/execute the upgrade plan
  to accomodate the difference. Do not accumulate upgrade plans across
  stages, but do it stage by stage. Within a stage, follow the normal
  sequence (add, upgrade, remove).
